# Web Page Classification System

This repo is a collection of code that make up a web page classification system.

The problem is a multilcass classification problem.

The classification algorithm is hierarchical classification with Random Forest and Feature Selection for Insight Analysis

The system works as follows:

- site data is scraped from labeled urls (not included in repo)
- features are built from parsed site data
- features are fed into a different learning algorithms for classification

Built using [Python], [SciKit Learn], [PyMongo], [Keras] and [Matplotlib].
